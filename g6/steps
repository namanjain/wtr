1) Say hello to everyone within 0.5 m to 2 m distance and update the wisdom
2) once step 1) is done, talk to a couple of players who we have said hello to and exhaust their wisdom
3) if said hello to everyone and had a good conversation with a couple of people, move to a new location.
the new location can be found by:
  a) going to a place within 2 to 6 distance where we can see there are more people we haven't met yet
  b) <add something>
